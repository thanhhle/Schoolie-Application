# Schoolie
An application written in Java


## Description
The Schoolie application is a refinement and modulation of school’s learning management system (i.e. Blackboard, CSULB Beachboard), yet offers free access for students without any intervention or control from school. This product provides a convenient and secure environment for students to communicate with each other and keep their school work updated with self-control.


### Major components
- Account: allows user to create and manage their own account, user is required to log in their account to access their database (profile information, calendar, classes, grades, documents)
- Help screen: gives users basic instruction to use the application
- Calendar: allows users to create events with deadlines
- Class: allows users to join group work areas corresponding to the class they are taking at school
- Grade: allows users to manage (create, edit, delete) class grades with customization of grade weight and grade scale and calculates the current grades based on grades entered
- Class member: allows users to view a list of members in each class, to block a specific user, and to open chat with other users
- Documents: allows user to manage (upload, edit, delete) files associated with each class
- Syllabus: allows user to manage (upload, edit, delete) syllabus associated with each class


## Product scope
The application’s purpose is to help students organize, maintain, and stay up to date with their classes. The software is created with the intention to be convenient and easy-to-use applications for students to use.  Our goal is to provide a system that is helpful to students that don’t have the necessary school applications to stay updated with their classes whether it’s for tests, homework, or any other documents.
